<p>
    Register_XH facilitates to restrict access to certain CMSimple_XH pages to
    registered users. Therefore it has a simple user and group management as
    well as a login form, with the optional possibility for visitors to register
    per email. It is used by some other plugins to add user management (e.g. <a
    href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Chat_XH">Chat_XH</a> and <a
    href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Forum_XH">Forum_XH</a>).

    5.4.0.
</p>
</section>

<section id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
    The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a
    href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation"> CMSimple_XH
    wiki</a> for further details.

    requirements are fulfilled.
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="settings">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
    The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
    the website's back-end. Select <i>Plugins</i> → <i>Register</i>.
</p>
<p>
    You can change the default settings of Register_XH under <i>Config</i>.
    Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon
    with your mouse.
</p>
<p>
    Localization is done under <em>Language</em>. You can translate the character
    strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available,
    or customize them according to your needs.
</p>
<p>
    The look of Register_XH can be customized under <i>Stylesheet</i>.
</p>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>

<section id="usage-administration">
<h3>User and Group Administration</h3>
<p>
    The first thing you should do is to adjust the user groups according to your
    needs. You can do this under <i>Plugins</i> → <i>Register</i> → <i>Group
    administration</i>. You can administrate the users under <i>Plugins</i> →
    <i>Register</i> → <i>User administration</i>. Both screens should be pretty
    much self explaining, but some notes about the latter seem appropriate:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    The selectbox allows to filter the users by an access group. When you add a
    new user, the filter is reset, as you might not be able to see the new user
    record otherwise. When you save the data all user records will be saved,
    even if they are filtered out.
</li>
<li>
    You can sort the user records by clicking on the respective column heading.
</li>
<li>
    The status can have one of the following values (the label of the values are
    language specific, and can be changed in the language settings):
<dl>
<dt>activated</dt>
<dd>The user has the full priviledges according to his groups.</dd>
<dt>locked</dt>
<dd>The user has the full priviledges according to his groups, but may not change his preferences.</dd>
<dt>deactivated</dt>
<dd>The user account is (temporarily) deactivated.</dd>
<dt>not yet activated</dt>
<dd>The user has registered, but the account has not been activated.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
    In both group as well as user administration adding or deleting a user is
    temporary; to make the changes permanent, you have to explicitly save them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note also, that the possibility to switch to admin mode after being
    logged in as registered admin has been removed. The call to
    <code>registeradminmodelink()</code> is now deprecated and doesn't return
    the link anymore. Plugins should not offer any backdoor to circumvent the
    core's login security.
</p>
</section>

<section id="usage-loginform">
<h3>Login Form</h3>
<p>
    To offer the user the possibility to log in and optionally register first,
    the <i>login form</i> must be displayed. You can put it in the template, so it's
    shown on all pages:
</p>
<pre>&lt;?=registerloginform()?&gt;</pre>
<p>
    Alternatively you can put it on one or several CMSimple pages:
</p>
<pre>{{{registerloginform()}}}</pre>
<p>
    In this case you might want to add the <i>logged in</i> form to the
    template. You can do so with the following call:
</p>
<pre>&lt;?=Register_loggedInForm()?&gt;</pre>
<p>
    If users forgot their password, they can request an email with intructions
    to reset their password. If registration of new users is allowed, they can
    register themselves, and an email with the activation link will be sent to
    them, so they can activate their account and log in nearly immediately. All
    this happens without requiring any actions from the admin, who will still
    receive copies of the emails to be informed.
</p>
<p>
    After successful login users can edit their user preferences, i.e. name,
    email address and password. Unregistering, i.e. deleting the account, is
    also possible via the preferences screen.
</p>
<p>
    Note that all login and logout attempts will be logged in CMSimple_XH's
    logfile.
</p>
</section>

<section id="usage-access">
<h3>Access to CMSimple Pages</h3>
<p>
    To restrict the access to a CMSimple page to certain user groups, you have
    to enter on that page:
</p>
<pre>{{{access('LIST-OF-GROUPS')}}}</pre>
<p>
    <code>LIST-OF-GROUPS</code> is a comma separated list of access groups that
    will have access to the page. For example:
</p>
<pre>{{{access('admin,member,guest')}}}</pre>
<p>
    or
</p>
<pre>{{{access('admin')}}}</pre>
</section>

<section id="usage-pages">
<h3>Special Pages</h3>
<p>
    Register_XH dynamically adds some special pages to CMSimple_XH, if these do
    not already exist. Usually you don't have to care about this, but you can
    use the feature to create your own pages with the respective heading, if you
    want to customize any of these pages beyond what's possible with adjusting
    the related language strings. The headings of these pages are specified by
    the <strong>actual values</strong> of the following language strings and the
    pages should contain the respective plugin call:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>register</i></dt>
<dd>The page where users can register for a new account.</dd>
<dd><pre>{{{registerUser()}}}</pre></dd>
<dt><i>forgot_password</i></dt>
<dd>The page where a user can request an email which allows to reset his password.</dd>
<dd><pre>{{{registerForgotPassword()}}}</pre></dd>
<dt><i>user_prefs</i></dt>
<dd>The page where a user can change his account setting.</dd>
<dd><pre>{{{registerUserPrefs()}}}</pre></dd>
<dt><i>login_error</i></dt>
<dd>The page where a user is informed about an invalid login attempt.</dd>
<dd>n/a</dd>
<dt><i>loggedout</i></dt>
<dd>The page that is displayed after a user has logged out.</dd>
<dd>n/a</dd>
<dt><i>loggedin</i></dt>
<dd>The page that is displayed after a user has logged in.</dd>
<dd>n/a</dd>
<dt><i>access_error</i></dt>
<dd>The page that is displayed when a user browses to a page he is not allowed to access.</dd>
<dd>n/a</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    Please note that the handling and recognition of these pages is a bit sloppy
    currently (e.g. it doesn't matter on which menu level they are defined), but
    this is likely to change in the future.
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    If any CMSimple_XH page inadvertently has a heading that is used for one of
    the <a href="#usage-pages">special Register_XH pages</a>, the plugin might
    not work as expected.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the PHP ini settings <code>max_input_vars</code>,
    <code>suhosin.post.max_vars</code> and <code>suhosin.request.max_vars</code>
    there is a limit on the maximum number of users that can be administrated in
    the plugin back-end. In a default configuration of PHP ≥ 5.3.9 at most 142
    users are allowed. The plugin checks this limit, and does not permit more
    users to be added. If this limit is exceeded, you have to administrate the
    users in <code>users.csv</code> manually.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
    Register was developed in 2007 by <a
    href="http://cmsimple.heinelt.eu/">Carsten Heinelt</a> based on Michael
    Svarrer's <a
    href="http://cmsimplewiki-com.keil-portal.de/doku.php?id=plugins:memberpages">Memberpages
    plugin</a>.. In 2010 he gave permission to <a
    href="http://www.ge-webdesign.de/cmsimpleplugins/">Gert Ebersbach</a> to
    adapt it to CMSimple_XH and to further improve it. The plugin was then
    distributed as Register_mod_XH. In 2012 Gert Ebersbach discontinued the
    developement, and gave me the permission to maintain and distribute the
    plugin. <em>Many thanks to Carsten Heinelt and Gert Ebersbach for their good
    work and the permission to further maintain the plugin</em>!
</p>
<p>
